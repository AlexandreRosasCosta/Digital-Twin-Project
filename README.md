# Digital Twin Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **Digital Twin architecture** for a **Smart Classroom** scenario, developed as part of the final project in *Engenharia Informática – Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (IPB)*.

The project explores **open-source platforms** for Digital Twin development, applying **AHP–TOPSIS** as a multi-criteria decision-making methodology to select the most suitable platform. The final implementation uses **Eclipse Ditto** at its core, integrated with IoT simulators, data pipelines, dashboards, and AI components.

## 📌 Objectives
- Evaluate the **capabilities and limitations** of different open-source Digital Twin platforms.  
- Develop a **functional Digital Twin** of a Smart Classroom with virtual sensors and actuators.  
- Produce **documentation and implementation guides** for reproducibility and future projects.

## 🏛️ Architecture

**Case Study: Smart Classroom**
- Virtual sensors: temperature, humidity, occupancy, energy.  
- Virtual actuators: window and lighting.  
- Pipeline:
  1. Wokwi/Unity → EMQX MQTT  
  2. EMQX MQTT → Eclipse Ditto  
  3. Eclipse Ditto → Telegraf / InfluxDB  
  4. Grafana / Node-RED / Unity / Ollama
